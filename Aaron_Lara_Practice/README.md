# Ruby on Rails Learning Path

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the RoR Learning Path!
Here, you'll find instructions for completing your learning path.

## The Challenge

The purpose of the challenge is for you to demonstrate your Ruby on Rails skills. This is your chance to show off everything you've learned during the course!

You will build and deliver a whole Ruby on Rails project on your own. We don't want to limit you by providing some fill-in-the-blanks exercises, but instead request you to build it from scratch. We hope you find this exercise challenging and engaging.

The goal is to build a RoR application which must include:

- Create an application that
  - Is connected to a PostgreSQL
  - Fetches data from Api (PokeApi) and save into a DB
  - Create a dashboard that is showing all pokemons saved
  - Create a form to save/edit/delete custom pokemons
  - API exposed to be consumed as JSON
- Adds authentication
- Unit, integration and system testing of happy/golden paths
- Follow conventions and good practices

Nice to have:

- Responsiveness
- Way to export all data to a CSV
- Search feature
- Application deployed, automated or manual deployment (Heroku, Digital Ocean, AWS)

## Requirements

- Use all that you've learned in the course:
  - Best practices
  - RoR basics
  - Error handling
  - Ruby gems
  - Design Patterns
  - Unit Test (RSpec, matchers, mocks)
  - E2E
